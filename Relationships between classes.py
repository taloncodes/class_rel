# sendReceipt method shows the relationship between different Classes. The Order class relies on both Product and
# Customer Classes by using their attributes in the method call. Payment Class uses the Customer ID and the Customer
# Name from the Customer class to keep track of payment and as part of the payment details.
# Payment also shared relationship with Order Class, to gain price information.
